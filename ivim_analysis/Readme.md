This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Intravoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) diffusion MRI data. The analysis includes loading and processing of DICOM files, ROI (Region of Interest) selection, fitting of the IVIM model, and visualization of the results.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Numpy, Nibabel, Dipy, Matplotlib, and other libraries as specified in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/ivim_analysis.git
cd ivim_analysis
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Analysis

To run the IVIM analysis, execute the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will process the data, fit the IVIM model, and output the results.

### Visualization

The visualization module provides various plots to help understand the data and the model's fit. Use the following command to visualize the results:

```bash
python visualization/plots.py
```

## Structure of the Project

- `data/`: Contains data loading and processing functions.
- `masks/`: Functions for generating and applying masks to the data.
- `models/`: Definitions and fitting procedures for the IVIM model.
- `visualization/`: Functions for visualizing the data and model results.
- `utils/`: Utility functions for mathematical operations and helper tasks.
- `main.py`: The entry point of the project, coordinates the workflow.

## Contributing
